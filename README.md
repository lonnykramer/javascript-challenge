# javascript-challenge

This project was an effort to increase skills and understanding of JavaScript and overall webdesign.  HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and CSS were used.

I explored a fictional dataset of UFO sightings and created a webpage with multiple searchable input fields.  With JavaScript and D3, the database was searched and a table was returned the results.

To add a little additional fun, I themed the page subtly with DC Joker colors.
